Final project of Mod 2 (Overlook Hotel)


## Abstract ##
This was the final project for Mod 2 at Turing School of Software and Design. It is a hotel booking application that allows a user to:
    
- log in to their personal account and see their dashboard
- see how much money they have spent so far
- manage their bookings 
- search for bookings based on date and type of room
- book any available room of their chosen criteria

## Goals and Accomplishments: ##

GET and POST
        -This project was my first experience using POST requests and implimenting error handling in fetch calls.

Unit testing

        - This project helped me get more comfortable and gain experince writing my own unit tests for the methods I created. I made sample data and with the help of beforeEach() managed to make the tests look clean and concise.
 
LOGIN functionality
       - I learned more about user authentification, although the login page isn't a "true" login, it was excellent practice figuring out what will be expected of me in the future.


Multiple APIs and classes
       - I had three sets of APIs to draw from, and created corraborating classes to help manipulate that data in my functions.


## Future Iterations ##

I would like to add a log out feature and get more CSS
