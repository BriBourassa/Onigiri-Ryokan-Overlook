    Final project of Mod 2 (Overlook Hotel)


## Abstract
    This was the final project for Mod 2 at Turing School of Software and Design. It is a hotel booking application that allows a user to:
    
     - log in to their personal account and see their dashboard
     - see how much money they have spent so far
     - manage their bookings 
     - search for bookings based on date and type of room
     - book any available room of their chosen criteria

## Goals and Accomplishments

    GET and POST
        -This project was my first experience using POST requests and implimenting error handling in fetch calls.

    Unit testing
        - This project helped me get more comfortable and gain experince writing my own unit tests for the methods I created. I made sample data and with the help of beforeEach() managed to make the tests look clean and concise.

    LOGIN functionality
        - I learned more about user authentification, although the login page isn't a "true" login, it was excellent practice figuring out what will be expected of me in the future.

    Multiple APIs and classes
        - I had three sets of APIs to draw from, and created corraborating classes to help manipulate that data in my functions.
